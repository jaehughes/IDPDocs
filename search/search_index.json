These will required the development of hardware, electronics and sensing and the accompanying control and software systems. Schedule The full overview schedule showing the key activities, and deadlines can be found here.The timetabled sessions are: Thursday 9-11 Monday 9-11 Wednesday 9-11 The EIETL is open from 8am-5pm, and can be used during these times. The Dyson centre is also available for use, however there is only technician support (which limits when some equipment in the Dyson centre) for limited periods. For design acceptance or functional demonstration outside of core IDP hours, the EIETL technicans can perform this (as long as they are not busy with other lab) in the following hours: Morning: 9:00 -11:30 Afternoon: 14:00 - 16:00 Task Each IDP cohort has a different task and rules set. A challenge set will be produced for each group, and the current (and existing challenges can be found here): If you have any questions about the task, please use the forum in the Moodle VLE in the first place, or email Josie Hughes (jaeh2). Resources Contact Should you have any questions or concerns during the project please in the first instance see a demonstrator who will be there at each lab session, the EIETL Technical Team, or email Josie Hughes (jaeh2).
