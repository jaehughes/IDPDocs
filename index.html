<h1 id="integrated-design-project-v20">Integrated Design Project V2.0</h1>
<p>In the integrated design project (IDP) students work in teams of 6 to develop an autonomous robotic system to solve a problem inspired by a real-world challenge. This will require the development of hardware, electronics and sensing and the accompanying control and software systems.  After 4 weeks there are competitions to assess the performance of the robots developed.</p>
<p>There are four weekly timetables sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thursday 9-11</li>
<li>Monday 11-1</li>
<li>Tuesday 9-11</li>
<li>Wednesday 9-11</li>
</ul>
<p>The EIETL is open 8am-5pm, and can be used during these times. The Dyson Centre is also available for use, however there is only technician support (which limits when some equipment can be used) for limited periods.  The laser cutter can be used 8am-5pm, and the 3D printers likewise. If you require out-of-hours access to the Dyson Centre, you must fill in the relevant forms.</p>
<p>It is expected per week you spend twice the scheduled time on this project.  You must use your university card to sign in for the lab before five past the hour of the official start of the session. Failure to do so will mean you are not marked as attending the lab.  Even when not working in the EIETL you must head there first to sign in.  </p>
<p><em>A copy of the presentation given in the first lecture can be found <a href="IntroLecture.pdf" download>here</a>.</em></p>
<p>The full timetable of events and deadlines is given below in the schedule and deadlines section.</p>
<h2 id="aims-objectives">Aims &amp; Objectives</h2>
<p>The key aim of the project is to develop an understanding of systems design and integration and also project management and team work skills to design and manufacture a system.  In particular, this involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing an understanding for systems design and systems integration.</li>
<li>appreciating the importance of co-ordinated teamwork and project management.</li>
<li>applying and integrating the engineering principles taught in Part I.</li>
<li>understand how to produce detailed design proposals.</li>
<li>gaining experience of building and testing a system once it has been designed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this project, rapid-prototyping techniques are used which enables quick development, integration and testing of systems and allows for multiple iterations of the system to be produced.</p>
<h2 id="task-and-team-allocation">Task and Team Allocation</h2>
<p>Each IDP cohort has a different task and rules set.  A challenge set will be produced for each group, and the current (and existing challenges) can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michaelmas 2018, <a href="m2task.pdf" download>M2 Task</a></li>
<li>Lent 2019, <a href="l1task.pdf" download>L1 Task</a></li>
</ul>
<p>with the team allocations give here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michaelmas 2018 <a href="m2teams.txt" download>Team Allocations</a></li>
<li>Lent 2019,  <a href="l1teams.txt" download>Team Allocations</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about the task, please email Dave Patterson (dip26) and Josie Hughes (jaeh2).</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<p>Team work is key to the success of this project.  Teams should elect one team leader during the first session. This is an <em>integrated</em> design project. Therefore, the main key elements (mechanics, electronics and software) cannot be considered in isolation, and for successful integration teams members cannot just be aware of one of these elements.  However, it may be useful to loosely assign two team members to each of these areas, with the understanding that communication and inter-disciplinary work is required. Additionally, the project may require agile distribution of the work force, for example with a greater focus on mechanical first to get a chassis built to enable successful integration.  <em>There is a project management session at 2pm first thursday. Make sure you attend this session.</em></p>
<h2 id="technologies-approach">Technologies &amp; Approach</h2>
<p>In this project, electronics and manufacturing approaches will be use which allow for rapid manufacturing, allowing for design integration and early integration of the system.  At the heart of the robot will be an Arduino Mega (or direct equivalent) Micro-Controller which can be programmed in C++.  Interface electronics will be created on prototyping board or vero-board, with the Arduinos providing digital and analogue interfaces.</p>
<p>The manufacturing techniques that will be use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laser Cutting MDF/Plywood</li>
<li>3D Printing</li>
</ul>
<p>These rapid manufacturing approaches will be augmented by using metal parts/cross section, and fastening methods including bolting and glueing.  We will also make cardboard available for creating mock-ups of the mechanical systems.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino software</a> can be downloaded for free, and likewise a student edition of Creo/Fusion 360 CAD software can be downloaded from their website.  Alternatively Solidworks can be downloaded or USB sticks from the library can be borrowed to install the software.  It may be useful to download and use this software on your personal computer.  </p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>Full resources including getting started guides and a list of parts can be found online on the resources page <a href="resources/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="parts-lists-and-kit-lists">Parts Lists and Kit Lists</h2>
<p>Full details of the available parts and datasheets can be found on the Moodle site which can be found <a href="https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=163282">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>The assessment of the course has a number of different components. These are summarised below and the weighting and deadline given.  Some assessment is performed at a group level, other at a sub-group level (e.g. for the electronics/software/mechanics) and the final report is assessed individually.  The weeks of the deadline correspond to the weeks into the project:</p>
