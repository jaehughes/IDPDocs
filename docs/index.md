# Integrated Design Project V2.0

In the integrated design project (IDP) teams work in teams of 6 to develop an autonomous robotic system to solve a problem inspired by a real-world challenge. These will required the development of hardware, electronics and sensing and the accompanying control and software systems.  Over 4 weeks teams develop a robot and at the end of the project there is a competition to assess the performance of the teams robots.

The lab lasts for four weeks, with three timetabled timetabled sessions:

* Thursday 9-11
* Monday 11-1
* Tuesday 9-11 (first week only!)
* Wednesday 9-11

The EIETL is open from 8am-5pm, and can be used during these times. The Dyson centre is also available for use, however there is only technician support (which limits when some equipment in the Dyson centre) for limited periods.  It is expected per week you spend twice the scheduled time on this project.  You must use your university card to sign in for the lab before the five past the hour official start of the project.

For design acceptance or functional demonstration outside of core IDP hours, the EIETL technicans can perform this (as long as they are not busy with other lab) in the following hours:

* Morning: 9:00 -11:30
* Afternoon: 14:00 - 16:00

The full timetable of events and deadlines is given below in the schedule and deadlines section.

## Task and Team Allocation

Each IDP cohort has a different task and rules set.  A challenge set will be produced for each group, and the current (and existing challenges can be found here):

* Michaelmas 2018, <a href="m2task.pdf" download>M2 Task</a>

If you have any questions about the task, please use the forum in the Moodle VLE in the first place, or email Josie Hughes (jaeh2).

## Project Management

Team work is key to the success of this project.  Teams should elect one team leader during the first session. This is an *integrated* design project. Therefore, the main key elements (mechanics, electronics and software) cannot be considered in isolation, and for successful integration teams members can not just be aware of one of these elements.  However, it may be useful to loosely assign two team members to each of these areas, with the understanding that communication and inter-disciplinary work is required. Additionally, the project may require adgile distribution of the work force, for example with a greater focus on mechanical first to get a chassis built to enable successful integration.

*There is a project management session at 2pm first thursday. Make sure you attend this session.*

## Assessment

The assessment of the course has a number of different components. These are summarised below and the weighting and deadline given. The weeks of the deadline correspond to the weeks into the project:

| Assessment     | Weighting | Deadline |
| -------------------------- |:-------------| -------------|
| Initial Report (Group)     | 5%          | Week 1, Tuesday|
| Initial Presentation(Group)| 5%          | Week 1, Wednesday|
| Design Assessment (Group)  | 10% [max 5% is deadline missed]| Week 2, Wednesday |
| Functional Demonstration (Group)| 10%     | Week 3, Wednesday |
| Competition Performance (Group) | 20%     | Week 4, Wednesday        |
| Final Presentation              | 20%     | Week 4, Wednesday     |
| Final Report                    | 20%     | Week 5, Monday  |


Detailed requirements and examples of the materials which must be submitted can be found [here](assesment.md).

## Schedule & Deadlines

The following table summarises the key activities and deadlines at each session.  The weeks refer to the number of week of the project - thus is you are doing the project in the second half of the term Week 1 will correspond to Week 5.
