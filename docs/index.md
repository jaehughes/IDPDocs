# Integrated Design Project V2.0

In the integrated design project (IDP) teams work in teams of 6 to develop an autonomous robotic system to solve a problem inspired by a real-world challenge. These will required the development of hardware, electronics and sensing and the accompanying control and software systems.

## Schedule

The full overview schedule showing the key activities, and deadlines can be found here.The timetabled sessions are:

* Thursday 9-11
* Monday 9-11

The EIETL is open from 8am-5pm, and can be used during these times. The Dyson centre is also available for use, however there is only technician support (which limits when some equipment in the Dyson centre) for limited periods.

For design acceptance or functional demonstration outside of core IDP hours, the EIETL technicans can perform this (as long as they are not busy with other lab) in the following hours:

* Morning: 9:00 -11:30
* Afternoon: 14:00 - 16:00
