# Integrated Design Project V2.0

In the integrated design project (IDP) teams work in teams of 6 to develop an autonomous robotic system to solve a problem inspired by a real-world challenge. These will required the development of hardware, electronics and sensing and the accompanying control and software systems.  Over 4 weeks teams develop a robot and at the end of the project there is a competition to assess the performance of the teams robots.

The lab lasts for four weeks, with three timetabled timetabled sessions:

* Thursday 9-11
* Monday 11-1
* Tuesday 9-11 (first week only!)
* Wednesday 9-11

The EIETL is open from 8am-5pm, and can be used during these times. The Dyson Centre is also available for use however there is only technician support (which limits when some equipment can be used) for limited periods.  The laser cutter can be used from 8am-5pm, and the 3D printers likewise. If you require out-of-hours access to the Dyson Centre, you must fill in the relevant forms.

It is expected per week you spend twice the scheduled time on this project.  You must use your university card to sign in for the lab before the five past the hour official start of the project, failure to do so will mean you are not marked as attending the lab.  Even when not working in the EIETL you must head there first to sign in.  

For design acceptance or functional demonstration outside of core IDP hours, the EIETL technicans can perform this (as long as they are not busy with other lab) in the following hours:

* Morning: 9:00 -11:30
* Afternoon: 14:00 - 16:00

The full timetable of events and deadlines is given below in the schedule and deadlines section.

## Aims & Objectives

The key aim of the project is to develop an understanding of systems design and integration and also how project management and team work skills to design and manufacture a system.  In particular, this involves:

• appreciate the nature of systems design.
• appreciate the importance of co-ordinated teamwork and project management.
• apply and integrate the engineering principles taught in Part I.
• understand how to produce detailed design proposals.
• gain experience of building and testing a system once it has been designed.


In this project, rapid-prototyping techniques are used which enables rapid development, integration and testing of systems, allowing for multiple iterations of the systems.

## Task and Team Allocation

Each IDP cohort has a different task and rules set.  A challenge set will be produced for each group, and the current (and existing challenges can be found here):

If you have any questions about the task, please email Dave Patterson (dip26) and Josie Hughes (jaeh2).

## Project Management

Team work is key to the success of this project.  Teams should elect one team leader during the first session. This is an *integrated* design project. Therefore, the main key elements (mechanics, electronics and software) cannot be considered in isolation, and for successful integration teams members can not just be aware of one of these elements.  However, it may be useful to loosely assign two team members to each of these areas, with the understanding that communication and inter-disciplinary work is required. Additionally, the project may require adgile distribution of the work force, for example with a greater focus on mechanical first to get a chassis built to enable successful integration.  *There is a project management session at 2pm first thursday. Make sure you attend this session.*

## Resources

Full resources including getting started guides and a list of parts can be found on the resources page [here](assesment.md).

## Assessment

The assessment of the course has a number of different components. These are summarised below and the weighting and deadline given.  Some assessment is performed at a group level, other at a sub-group level (e.g. for the electronics/software/mechanics) and the final report is assessed individually.  The weeks of the deadline correspond to the weeks into the project:

| Assessment     | Weighting | Deadline |
| -------------------------- |:-------------| -------------|
| Initial Presentation (Group)     | 10%          | Week 1, Tuesday|
| Initial Report (Group)| 10%          | Week 1, Wednesday|
| Design Assessment (Sub-Group)  | 5% [2% is deadline missed]| Week 2, Wednesday |
| Functional Demonstration (Group)| 5% [2% is deadline missed]   | Week 3, Wednesday |
| Competition Performance (Group) | 20%     | Week 4, Wednesday        |
| Final Presentation (Group)             | 20%     | Week 4, Wednesday     |
| Robot Quality (Sub-Team)             | 10%     | Week 4, Wednesday     |
| Final Report (Individual)                    | 20%     | Week 5, Monday  |


Detailed requirements and examples of the materials which must be submitted can be found [here](assesment.md).  Reports and presentations should be submitted online on the IDP Moodle Page, which can be found here.
