# IDP: Assessment

###Initial Presentation & Report
#### Initial Presentation (presented as a group)

The initial presentation should be no longer than 10 minutes, to leave a further 10 minutes for discussion and Q&A.   This should include a maximum of 8 slides which should cover the following:

Overall System Level Diagram
Overall System
Electronics/Sensing
Exploration and navigation algorithms
Gantt Chart (resource/time allocation)
If you have at this point a cardboard model/diagrams this should be brought a long.  A printed copy of the report should be brought to the presentation, and the presentation should also be submitted on Moodle.

####Initial Report (submitted as a group)

The initial report should reflect the feedback given the initial presentation. It should be a maximum of 6 pages.

It should be submitted online on Moodle.

##Design Assessment
Design assessment (DA)

####Electrical Design Acceptance

For electrical DA we require:

Circuit diagram.  An example can be found here.
Layout diagrams.  An example can be found here.
These can be produced by hand or using CAD software, what matters is that they are clear and correct.   Software such as LTSpice (which is installed on the department PCs) can be used, equally there are free online circuit drawing systems including circuit-diagram or circuitlab.

####Mechanical Design Acceptance

For mechanical design acceptance, we want to.  These should be sufficient for you to construct your robot, and to use the files to laser cut/3D print parts as required.

Overall CAD Drawing
System CAD Drawings

####Software/Overall Design Acceptance

For software design acceptance we want to see an overall system diagram, to show how the entire system will integrate together.  Additionally, we require details of the algorithms that will be used - this could be pictorial/flow-chart or another say of representing the overall approach and strategy.

System Diagram.  An example can be found here.
Algorithm. An example can be found here.
