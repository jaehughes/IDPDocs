# IDP: Resources

## Platform

In this project, we will be used an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) (or OrangePip) as the micro-controller.  The Arduino is a low-cost microcontroller which is programmed in C++ via USB and has digital inputs/outputs, analogue inputs and PWM sockets.  This allows for different sensors/output devices to be controlled.  The mechanical system will be developed using laser cutting, 3D printing and other rapid fabrication methods.

## Hardware

The key components and links to datasheets are given here.  In addition to these there is a store of standard electronic parts.

Microcontroller & Drivers:

* OrangePip ([Arduino](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) replica) (x2)
* {Velleman Arduino Motor Driver}(https://www.velleman.eu/products/view/?id=412538&country=be&lang=en)
* Prototyping Shield
* Veroboard + Connectors

Sensors

* Camera
* Compass/Accelerometer
* IR Sensors
* IR Distance Sensor
* Photoresistor
* IR diodes

Mechanical Components:

* Motors
* Wheels
* Servos
* Wheel Casters
* Bearing Casters

Other:
* Mains to 9V Power Supply (with split ends to power Arduino + Motor Controller)
* USB Lead x 2

A list to all other components available can be found [here](http://www3.eng.cam.ac.uk/DesignOffice/idp/resources/webcat/index.html).

## Electronics: Getting Started

We suggest you take a little bit of time familiarising yourself with the Arduino and reading from sensors and setting outputs.  There is some cross over between this and the software groups, however, 2 Arduino have been provided per team to allow you to both work on this.

The Arduino IDE software is installed on the teaching system, or can be used online, or can be downloaded (for free) on to your personal computer.

**Familiarisation with the Arduino**

* If you are using the web IDE, follow this into [tutorial](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/getting-started-with-arduino-web-editor-on-various-platforms-4b3e4a).
* If you are using th desktop IDE, follow this tutorial.

Make sure you can run the 'blinky LED' script and your LED changes.

Things to consider when designing your electronics:
* Do you need a switch/interface to start your robot/reset?
* Talk with mechanics/software, how are you going to mount your sensors?
* Should sensors give you a digital/analogue input? Can you convert to a digital input to reduce the load on the software team?
* How can you connect to the electronics?




## Software: Getting Started

To start with, you should gain familiarity with the Arduino and software and achieve the basics: control of motors, reading from sensors and
