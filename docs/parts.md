# IDP: Parts Lists


## Platform

In this project, we will be used an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) (or OrangePip) as the micro-controller.  The Arduino is a low-cost microcontroller which is programmed in C++ via USB and has digital inputs/outputs, analogue inputs and PWM sockets.  This allows for different sensors/output devices to be controlled.  The mechanical system will be developed using laser cutting, 3D printing and other rapid fabrication methods.


### Microcontroller & Drivers:

* OrangePip ([Arduino](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) replica) (x2 per team)
* [Arduino Motor Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438)
* [Prototyping Shield](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mega-proto-shield-rev3-pcb)
* Veroboard + Connectors
* Breadboard for prototyping
