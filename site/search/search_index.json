These will required the development of hardware, electronics and sensing and the accompanying control and software systems. Over 4 weeks teams develop a robot and at the end of the project there is a competition to assess the performance of the teams robots. The lab lasts for four weeks, with three timetabled timetabled sessions: Thursday 9-11 Monday 11-1 Tuesday 9-11 (first week only!) Wednesday 9-11 The EIETL is open from 8am-5pm, and can be used during these times. The Dyson centre is also available for use, however there is only technician support (which limits when some equipment in the Dyson centre) for limited periods. It is expected per week you spend twice the scheduled time on this project. For design acceptance or functional demonstration outside of core IDP hours, the EIETL technicans can perform this (as long as they are not busy with other lab) in the following hours: Morning: 9:00 -11:30 Afternoon: 14:00 - 16:00 The full timetable of events and deadlines is given below in the schedule and deadlines section. Task and Team Allocation Each IDP cohort has a different task and rules set. A challenge set will be produced for each group, and the current (and existing challenges can be found here): Michaelmas 2018, M2 Task With the team allocations give here: * Michaelmas 2018 Team Allocations If you have any questions about the task, please use the forum in the Moodle VLE in the first place, or email Josie Hughes (jaeh2). Project Management Team work is key to the success of this project. Teams should elect one team leader during the first session. This is an integrated design project. Therefore, the main key elements (mechanics, electronics and software) cannot be considered in isolation, and for successful integration teams members can not just be aware of one of these elements. However, it may be useful to loosely assign two team members to each of these areas, with the understanding that communication and inter-disciplinary work is required. Additionally, the project may require adgile distribution of the work force, for example with a greater focus on mechanical first to get a chassis built to enable successful integration. There is a project management session at 2pm first thursday. Make sure you attend this session. Resources Full resources including getting started guides and a list of parts can be found on the resources page project license for further details.. Assessment The assessment of the course has a number of different components. These are summarised below and the weighting and deadline given. The weeks of the deadline correspond to the weeks into the project: Assessment Weighting Deadline Initial Report (Group) 10% Week 1, Thursday Initial Presentation(Group) 10% Week 1, Thursday Design Assessment (Group) 10% Week 2, Functional Demonstration (Group) 10% Week 2, Competition Performance (Group) 10% Week 3, Final Presentation 20% Week 4, Wed Final Report 10% Week 5, Monday Detailed requirements and examples of the materials which must be submitted can be found here. Schedule & Deadlines The following table summarises the key activities and deadlines at each session. The weeks refer to the number of week of the project - thus is you are doing the project in the second half of the term Week 1 will correspond to Week 5.

A printed copy of the report should be brought to the presentation, and the presentation should also be submitted on Moodle. Initial Report (submitted as a group) The initial report should reflect the feedback given the initial presentation. It should be a maximum of 6 pages. It should be submitted online on Moodle. Design Assessment Design assessment (DA) Electrical Design Acceptance For electrical DA we require: Circuit diagram. An example can be found here. Layout diagrams. An example can be found here. These can be produced by hand or using CAD software, what matters is that they are clear and correct. Software such as LTSpice (which is installed on the department PCs) can be used, equally there are free online circuit drawing systems including circuit-diagram or circuitlab. Mechanical Design Acceptance For mechanical design acceptance, we want to. These should be sufficient for you to construct your robot, and to use the files to laser cut/3D print parts as required. Overall CAD Drawing System CAD Drawings Software/Overall Design Acceptance For software design acceptance we want to see an overall system diagram, to show how the entire system will integrate together. Additionally, we require details of the algorithms that will be used - this could be pictorial/flow-chart or another say of representing the overall approach and strategy. System Diagram.
