These will required the development of hardware, electronics and sensing and the accompanying control and software systems. Over 4 weeks teams develop a robot and at the end of the project there is a competition to assess the performance of the robots developed. The lab lasts for four weeks, with three weekly timetabled sessions: Thursday 9-11 Monday 11-1 Tuesday 9-11 (first week only!) Wednesday 9-11 The EIETL is open from 8am-5pm, and can be used during these times. The Dyson Centre is also available for use however there is only technician support (which limits when some equipment can be used) for limited periods. The laser cutter can be used from 8am-5pm, and the 3D printers likewise. If you require out-of-hours access to the Dyson Centre, you must fill in the relevant forms. It is expected per week you spend twice the scheduled time on this project. You must use your university card to sign in for the lab before the five past the hour official start of the project failure to do so will mean you are not marked as attending the lab. Even when not working in the EIETL you must head there first to sign in. A copy of the presentation give in the first lecture can be found here . The full timetable of events and deadlines is given below in the schedule and deadlines section. Aims & Objectives The key aim of the project is to develop an understanding of systems design and integration and also project management and team work skills to design and manufacture a system. In particular, this involves: developing an understanding for systems design and systems integration. appreciate the importance of co-ordinated teamwork and project management. apply and integrate the engineering principles taught in Part I. understand how to produce detailed design proposals. gain experience of building and testing a system once it has been designed. In this project, rapid-prototyping techniques are used which enables quick development, integration and testing of systems, allowing for multiple iterations of the system to be produced. Task and Team Allocation Each IDP cohort has a different task and rules set. A challenge set will be produced for each group, and the current (and existing challenges can be found here): Michaelmas 2018, M2 Task With the team allocations give here: Michaelmas 2018 Team Allocations If you have any questions about the task, please email Dave Patterson (dip26) and Josie Hughes (jaeh2). Project Management Team work is key to the success of this project. Teams should elect one team leader during the first session. This is an integrated design project. Therefore, the main key elements (mechanics, electronics and software) cannot be considered in isolation, and for successful integration teams members can not just be aware of one of these elements. However, it may be useful to loosely assign two team members to each of these areas, with the understanding that communication and inter-disciplinary work is required. Additionally, the project may require agile distribution of the work force, for example with a greater focus on mechanical first to get a chassis built to enable successful integration. There is a project management session at 2pm first thursday. Make sure you attend this session. Technologies & Approach In this project, electronics and manufacturing approaches will be use which allow for rapid manufacturing, allowing for design integration and early integration of the system. At the heart of the robot will be an Arduino Mega (or direct equivalent) Micro-Controller which can be programmed in C++. Interface electronics will be created on prototyping board or vero-board, with the Arduinos providing digital and analogue interfaces. The manufacturing techniques that will be use include: Laser Cutting MDF/Plywood 3D Printing These rapid manufacturing approaches will be augmented by using metal parts/cross section, and fastening methods including bolting and glueing. We will also make cardboard available for creating mock-ups of the mechanical systems. The Arduino software can be downloaded for free, and likewise a student edition of Creo/Fusion 360 CAD software can be downloaded from their website, alternatively Solidworks can be downloaded or USB sticks from the library can be borrowed to install the software. It may be useful to download and use this software on your personal computer. Resources Full resources including getting started guides and a list of parts can be found online on the resources page here . Assessment The assessment of the course has a number of different components. These are summarised below and the weighting and deadline given. Some assessment is performed at a group level, other at a sub-group level (e.g. for the electronics/software/mechanics) and the final report is assessed individually.

This should be thought of as a the team acting as a consultancy pitching your overall system to your clients. This should include a maximum of 8 slides which should cover the following: Team Name and Management Structure Concept and diagram. This could be hand-drawn diagrams, CAD models or any format which conveys the approach and concept Overall System Level Diagram. Detailing how the electronics, hardware and software interacts Electronics/Sensing. This could include circuit diagrams/block diagrams as to the approach Exploration and navigation algorithms Gantt Chart (resource/time allocation) Any cardboard models/diagrams this should be brought a long for discussion. A printed copy of the report should be brought to the presentation, and the presentation should also be submitted on Moodle. Initial Report (submitted as a group) The initial report should provide a more detailed reflection of the planned system, and where possible reflect the feedback given the initial presentation. It should be a maximum of 6 pages and focus on the same content as given in the First Presentation. The first report should be submitted online on Moodle, only one must be submitted per team. The file name should include the Team Number. Design Acceptance Design acceptance is documentation that must be produced by teams, and is marked as pass/fail. Teams are free to test and develop hardware/software before they gain design acceptance, however, where possible no fully permanent manufacturing should be made before design acceptance. We encourage teams to get design acceptance as early as possible. Software/Overall Design Acceptance For software design acceptance we want to see an overall system diagram, to show how the entire system will integrate together. Additionally, we require details of the algorithms that will be used - this could be pictorial/flow-chart or another say of representing the overall approach and strategy. System Diagram. An example can be found here. Algorithm. An example can be found here. Electrical Design Acceptance For electrical DA we require: Circuit diagram. To clearly communicate the circuits that will be implmented. Each circuit which is going to be created should be document. An example, and notes and hints and tips can be found here. Layout diagrams. An example can be found here. These can be produced by hand or using CAD software, what matters is that they are clear and correct. Software such as LTSpice (which is installed on the department PCs) can be used, equally there are free online circuit drawing systems including circuit-diagram or circuitlab. Fritzing is another online tool (specifically for Arduinos etc. which allows creation of both circuit and layout diagrams and may be a useful tool. Mechanical Design Acceptance For mechanical design acceptance, we want to. These should be sufficient for you to construct your robot, and to use the files to laser cut/3D print parts as required. We want to know what material you have to chosen to use and why as part of the submitted designs. Overall CAD Drawing. System CAD Drawings. Functional Demonstration The aim of functional demonstration is to show that integration of the different sub-systems has been achieved and to encourage teams to perform early integration. They are to demonstrate that the core competencies required for the competition task can be achieved. This is help evaluate the system, if, the robot fails to achieve as well as expected in competition. Functional Demonstration #1: Moving chassis that can navigate without crashing into walls. Functional Demonstration #2: Correct identification of the test object. Final Presentation & Competition The final presentation and competition will have the following format and order: 10 minute presentation Competition run (approximately 10 minutes) 5-10 minutes Q&A. Allows for reflections on how the robot performed. The final presentation (maximum of 8 slides) should focus on the following: Brief review of the overall design strategy Sub-team designs Problems encountered during implementation Changes to the original design and reasons for these Remaining problems Brief statement of likely performance in the competition.

There is some cross over between this and the software groups, however, 2 Arduino have been provided per team to allow you to both work on this. The Arduino IDE software is installed on the teaching system, or can be used online, or can be downloaded (for free) on to your personal computer. First, you need to familiarise yourself with the board and the different pins. Read through this page to understand the different inputs types and how the board works. Familiarisation with the Arduino If you are using the web IDE, follow this into tutorial . If you are using th desktop IDE, follow this tutorial. Make sure you can run the 'blinky LED' script and your LED changes. Connect an LED to the Arduino Using your breadboard, now wire up an LED to another digital input on your Arduino, as shown in the figure below You can use jumpers to connect to the Arduino and to the LED; make sure you connect the LED the correct way around and use a current limiting resistor. Change the program written in the previous task to write to the new digital input with the LED is attached to. Read from the Analogue Input Connect the LDR on breadboard with another resistor to form a potential divider as shown. Connect the middle of this potential divider to the analogue Input. We can now using the following to read from the analog input and then print to the to the serial monitor. The serial monitor can help for debugging. Check that the sensor values change when the LDR is covered. int sensorPin = A0; // select the input pin for the potentiometer int sensorValue = 0; // variable to store the value coming from the sensor void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); //Start serial and set the correct Baud Rate } void loop() { sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); Serial.println(sensorValue); } Wire-up motor controllers Using the datasheets and documents and examples sketches, wire up the motors. Designing your electronics and sensing? Things to consider when designing your electronics: Do you need a switch/interface to start your robot/reset? Talk with mechanics/software, how are you going to mount your sensors? Should sensors give you a digital/analogue input? Can you convert to a digital input to reduce the load on the software team? How can you connect to the electronics? Make sure you look at the assessment page to see what is required for Design Acceptance and what must be achieved by when. Practical Advice Soldering Software: Getting Started To start with, you should gain familiarity with the Arduino and software and achieve the basics: control of motors, reading from sensors and Familiarisation with the Arduino Motor Control Reading from Sensors Interfacing to Python Things to consider when developing your software: * Do you need a switch/interface to start your robot/reset? Mechanics: Getting Started Start designing your chassis. Advice on CAD for laser cutting: https://www.sculpteo.com/blog/2017/06/14/use-fusion-360-cad-software-for-laser-cutting Deparment Rapid Prototyping Facilities Information on the rapid prototyping facilities available in the department can be found here: Laser Cutting 3D Printing Plasma Cutter The laser cutter may be busy - there are training sessions daily at 12-13 and 14-15; these times should be avoided. The laser cutter should only not be used out of hours and particular care should be taken when cardboard is cut, as this is easily flammable. Things to consider when developing your software: What pins/how will you be interfacing with the electronics sensors? How can you test the software?

There is some cross over between this and the software groups, however, 2 Arduino have been provided per team to allow you to both work on this. The Arduino IDE software is installed on the teaching system, or can be used online, or can be downloaded (for free) on to your personal computer. First, you need to familiarise yourself with the board and the different pins. Read through this page to understand the different inputs types and how the board works. Familiarisation with the Arduino If you are using the web IDE, follow this into tutorial . If you are using th desktop IDE, follow this tutorial. Make sure you can run the 'blinky LED' script and your LED changes. Connect an LED to the Arduino Using your breadboard, now wire up an LED to another digital input on your Arduino, as shown in the figure below You can use jumpers to connect to the Arduino and to the LED; make sure you connect the LED the correct way around and use a current limiting resistor. Change the program written in the previous task to write to the new digital input with the LED is attached to. Read from the Analogue Input Connect the LDR on breadboard with another resistor to form a potential divider as shown. Connect the middle of this potential divider to the analogue Input. We can now using the following to read from the analog input and then print to the to the serial monitor. The serial monitor can help for debugging. Check that the sensor values change when the LDR is covered. int sensorPin = A0; // select the input pin for the potentiometer int sensorValue = 0; // variable to store the value coming from the sensor void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); //Start serial and set the correct Baud Rate } void loop() { sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); Serial.println(sensorValue); } Wire-up motor controllers Using the datasheets and documents and examples sketches, wire up the motors. Designing your electronics and sensing? Things to consider when designing your electronics: Do you need a switch/interface to start your robot/reset? Talk with mechanics/software, how are you going to mount your sensors? Should sensors give you a digital/analogue input? Can you convert to a digital input to reduce the load on the software team? How can you connect to the electronics? Make sure you look at the assessment page to see what is required for Design Acceptance and what must be achieved by when.
